# KeyTranslator
## What is this?
This is a simple C++ tool that allows me to translate a keyboard layout to another.

This is a simple and fairly useless tool for most people, but I made it just for using it on my school's computers.
The school PCs don't give me admin permission so I used a workaround.
If you want to modify the tool to include other layouts, go right ahead, but there's probably better ways to do this.

## How it works
It's actually quite simple. All it does is whenever I press a key, it will delete that key and replace it with the colemak key.

## Why even bother?
* After using colemak for almost a year, it's a pain to use the QWERTZ layout.
* I chose to then write this as a small experiment, mainly out of curiosity if it'd even work well.
* This is NOT a good tool to use daily but for a few quick school projects in class, it works.
